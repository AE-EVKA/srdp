# The Single-Repo Data Platform (SRDP)

SRDP is a self-hostable data platform assembled from established open-source components (Zitadel, Traefik, Dagster, dbt, DuckDB/DuckLake, Polars, marimo, and more) and deployed from a single Git repository. It is aimed at teams that want a coherent, governable data stack without operating a large set of separately managed services.[^1]

The same logical architecture runs from a laptop (Docker Compose) to a single VM to a Kubernetes cluster, so development and production stay aligned.

[^1]: The single-repository approach takes inspiration from the [Instant OpenHIE](https://openhie.github.io/instant/) project, which packages an open-source health information exchange the same way.
